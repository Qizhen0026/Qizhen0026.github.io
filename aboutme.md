My name is Qizhen Xie 谢奇臻

My main interest lies in the Hellenistic world, particularly in the development of administration 
and bureaucracy from early to mid Hellenistic period (cir. 300-150 BCE). 
At Brown,I further explore questions concerning how the romance of “spear-won land (δορίκτητος χώρα)” 
was grounded in and realized through fiscality and day-to-day management.
