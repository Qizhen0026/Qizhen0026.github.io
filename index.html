I earned my B.A. from University of New Hampshire with a double major in History (honors) and Classics in 2016.

In the summer of 2015, I had the honor of joining the excavation at Çadır Höyük in Yozgat, Turkey 
from which he studied an extensive amount of material evidence for his Honors Thesis titled 
The Ethnic Identity and Redefinition of the Galatians in the Hellenistic World. 
Between 2016 and 2017, he worked for Dickinson College in editing digital Latin-Chinese and Greek Chinese lexicons, 
taking advantage of his training in Greek and Latin and background as a native Chinese speaker. 

I earned his M.A. in History at University of New Hampshire in 2019. 
His main interest lies in the Hellenistic world, particularly in the development of administration and bureaucracy 
from early to mid Hellenistic period (cir. 300-150 BCE). At Brown, I further explore questions concerning 
how the romance of “spear-won land (δορίκτητος χώρα)” was grounded in and realized through fiscality and day-to-day management.
