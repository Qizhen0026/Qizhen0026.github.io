title: Hello!
subtitle: I am Qizhen. Welcome to my website!

My main interest lies in the Hellenistic world, particularly in the development of administration and bureaucracy 
from early to mid Hellenistic period (cir. 300-150 BCE). 
<br><br>
I earned my B.A. from University of New Hampshire with a double major in History (honors) and Classics in 2016.
<br><br>
In the summer of 2015, I had the honor of joining the excavation at Çadır Höyük in Yozgat, Turkey
from which I studied an extensive amount of material evidence for his Honors Thesis titled
The Ethnic Identity and Redefinition of the Galatians in the Hellenistic World. 
<br><br>
Between 2016 and 2017, I worked for Dickinson College in editing digital Latin-Chinese and Greek Chinese lexicons, 
taking advantage of his training in Greek and Latin and background as a native Chinese speaker. 
<br><br>
In 2019, I earned my M.A. in History at University of New Hampshire. 
<br><br>
Afterwards, I became a doctoral student in Brown Classics and History Departments and further explore questions concerning 
how the romance of “spear-won land (δορίκτητος χώρα)” was grounded in and realized through fiscality and day-to-day management.
